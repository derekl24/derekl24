- 👋 Hi, I'm Derek! Welcome to my Github!
- 👀 Based out of NYC, I'm currently a Technical Product/Program Manager at Palantir Technologies for our Apollo platform! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning any and all things in the blockchain space. At the time of writing, I haven't figured out what applications of blockchain technology interest me the most yet. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting applications of blockchain tech - anything ranging from protcol/infra design to DeFi and blockchain data analytics. 
- 📫 Shoot me an email at derekcrypto2@gmail.com, over on telegram at https://t.me/leederek if you want to get in touch!
