- 👋 Hi, I'm Derek! Welcome to my repository of random, blockchain projects!
- 📍 Based out of NYC, I'm currently a Technical Product/Program Manager at Palantir Technologies for our Apollo platform! 
- 📗 I’m currently learning about any and all things in the blockchain space. At the time of writing, I haven't figured out what applications of blockchain technology interest me yet, but am currently focused on Chainlink Oracles, big data blockchain analytics, & level-ing up my Solidity skills.
- 💻 I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting applications of blockchain tech - anything ranging from protcol/infra design to DeFi, DAOs, and blockchain data analytics! 
- 📫 To get in touch, contact me at [derekcrypto2@gmail.com](derekcrypto2@gmail.com), over on [Telegram](https://t.me/leederek), or on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/derek-f-lee)!
